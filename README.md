# Portfolio-2 Building a Sandboxed Network
# Aims
A sandboxed network provides an essential learning environment and platform, offering a secure, isolated space to simulate real-world network scenarios without introducing risks to live systems. For this Portfolio, you will create your own private sandboxed virtual network using VirtualBox. The network will consist of multiple virtual machines (VMs) configured within a private IP address range. The aim is to gain an applied understanding of networking concepts, IP subnetting, network interface configuration, and a basic server setup, design, planning and organisation strategies.
